# Ice-Hockey
A C implementation of Ice Hockey game

Here is yet another program on Computer Graphics. ICE-HOCKEY, we usually find this game in malls. So here we have a player playing(you) and an AI bot.
The AI bot has 3 levels (easy,medium hard), these levels are nothing but the speed at which ball can defend the ball when we try to score a goal.
The AI bot moves according to the ball coordinates obviously with a lag.
ENJOY
